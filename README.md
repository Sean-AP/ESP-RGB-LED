# ESP-RGB-LED

An embedded software project for controlling LED strips using an ESP8266 microcontroller<br>
The project consists of three main folders: **software**, **pcb**, and **housing**
<br>
<br>

## Software
A MicroPython module that can control an LED strip using the GPIO pins of an ESP8266 microcontroller
<br>
Input is received via wifi, written in a custom Python-like language which is parsed and executed onboard
<br>
<br>

## PCB
A KiCAD project to design a PCB to power the ESP8266 and LED strip
<br>
<br>

## Housing
A SOLIDWORKS project to design a 3D-printable housing for the PCB
